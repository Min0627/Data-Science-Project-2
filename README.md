# Data-Science-Project-2
# 📊 Data Storytelling Project — STQD6014 (Semester 2, 2024/2025)

Welcome to my data visualization and storytelling project, created as part of the **Master of Science in Data Science and Analytics** program at **UKM**.

As a data scientist, one of my core roles is to uncover hidden stories in raw data and transform them into actionable insights through compelling visualizations. This project reflects my skills and passion for turning complex data into easy-to-understand narratives that empower decision-making.
